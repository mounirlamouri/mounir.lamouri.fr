Last Friday (November 13 2009), I gave a presentation titled
*Mozilla and its technologies* in the context of the [Mozilla Campus
Reps](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/campusreps) program. Indeed, I am a Mozilla
Campus Rep at [INSA Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/en), my university.

The presentation had four parts. First of them was a classic presentation of
Mozilla and Netscape history. Then, a presentation of some Mozilla
projects like applications, libraries, tools and especially [Mozilla
Labs](https://mozillalabs.com/). The real technical part was about the Mozilla Platform (Gecko,
XUL, ...). To complete, the Open Web and web standards.

Everything went well. I planned to give a 30-minute to 45-minute length
presentation with 15 minutes of questions but it looks like I had a lot of
things to say and I talked one hour long. Fortunately, there wasn't a
lot of questions so I finished in time.  
The most important is I had only good feedback which is pretty cool for
a first experience!

The Mozilla campus Reps program wasn't able to send me a swag pack so I
asked to Tristan Nitot (Mozilla Europe) who seemed delighted to help.
Paul Rouget (Mozilla Europe too) also helped with some advices. A big
thank you to both of them!

Finally, you can download [my slides](http://dl.oldworld.fr/mozilla-campus-reps/presentation-at-insa-lyon.pdf). You can also get the source
files [here](http://dl.oldworld.fr/mozilla-campus-reps/). The slides have been
made in [latex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) with [beamer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_%28LaTeX%29).

The slides aren't really verbose. They have been made only to get
attention of the audience and let them follow me. I've spoke about a lot
of subjects that are not even mentioned like JavaScript benchmarking,
V8, FOSS work-flow... I find it more dynamic and -I hope- less boring
for the audience.

It was a nice experience and I'm glad to have spread Firefox and Mozilla!
