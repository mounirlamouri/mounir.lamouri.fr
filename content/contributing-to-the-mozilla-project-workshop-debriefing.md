Two weeks ago, the 13th of November, Vivien Nicolas, [Pascal Chevrel](http://www.chevrel.org/fr/carnet/)
and I organized a workshop in the Paris office. The goal of the workshop
was to meet people who want to contribute to the Mozilla project and
help them. By contributions, we meant any kind of contributions, from
beta testing, bug reporting, regression window to bug fixing.

Amongst the ten people who came, I mostly worked with two guys, Anas
Husseini (Arabic translator of Firefox) and Emmanuel Gil Peyrot. Both of
them were interested in contributing to the Mozilla's platform.  
With Anas, I worked on [bug 606491](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606491). He didn't seem really impressed
by the code base and was quite quick. Unfortunately, he left soon and we
hadn't enough time to update all the tests to reflect this change.  
With Emmanuel, we worked on [bug 606990](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606990) which is, as you can see
*RESOLVED FIXED*. I'm glad this change has been approved and pushed and
I hope Anas' patch will be very soon.

I've also spoken a lot with [Jérémie Patonnier](http://jeremie.patonnier.net/) about HTML5 Forms.
It's always very instructive to speak with webdevs about concrete use
cases and needs they have.

Finally, the workshop went very well with a good atmosphere and I hope
we will be able to repeat that again later. If there are two things we
should improve it's being more prepared because it was a bit hard at
some point to help all these people with only the three of us. Also, for
the platform contributions, having a few computers ready with an
up-to-date and compiled tree would be better given that these steps took
a very long time.
