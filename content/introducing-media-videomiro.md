[Miro](http://getmiro.com/) described itself as *Open-source, non-profit video player and
podcast client*. It's actually somewhat a swiss-knife for videos if you
are using video sharing services (like youtube or dailymotion),
following podcasts and downloading videos via bittorrent.  
Miro lets you do everything in one place. You can directly search for a
video, download it and see it locally. Then you can organize your videos
whatever it comes from and remove them when you want. To me, it's sound
like the equivalent of [songbird](http://getsongbird.com/) for videos.

Miro is also known for it's ["Adopt a line"](https://www.getmiro.com/adopt/) campaign which
consist of paying 4$ per month to adopt a line of code and support the
project. An innovative idea which seems to work.

So, [bug 131527](https://bugs.gentoo.org/131527) is now fixed and Miro is known as media-video/miro in
Gentoo's tree.  
Try it and report bugs !
