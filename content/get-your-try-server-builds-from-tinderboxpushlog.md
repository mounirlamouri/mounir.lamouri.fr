Title: Get your try server builds from TinderboxPushlog

Last month, I've added a very simple feature that might help try servers
users and even people who want to test try server builds. It's currently
a pain to get try server builds when you didn't get the try server email
with the URL. This URL isn't random or seriously complex, it's just
quite long and it includes the pusher email address and the revision id.

From now, if you select a successful try server build, you will see a
'go to build directory' link just before the 'view briew log' link. A
screenshot might be better than a complex description:  
<a href='../../static/imgages/tryserver-builds.png'><img height='150' title='screenshot' src='../../static/imgages/tryserver-builds.png'></a>

I'm blogging about this so late because I realized that a lot of people
didn't see this feature and were looking for something similar. I guess
a post to planet is the best way to spread the news.
