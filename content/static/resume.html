  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>I am a Platform Engineer looking for challenging projects that have an
  impact on people.</p>

  <p>I worked in the video-game industry for a cumulative time of 2 years,
  shipping two AAA games and one independent game. Since then, I have been
  working on improving the Web Platform with Mozilla.</p>

  <p>I developed a keen interest in Web Standards and designing APIs for the
  Web and would like to keep working on making the Web a better place.</p>

  <p>I like to write clean, simple and tested code. My main programming language
  is C++ and I have - from little to heavy - professional experiences with C,
  Java, Python, Objective-C, Bash, and Javascript/HTML/CSS.</p>

        While at university, I did a few internships and short term contracts at
        Ubisoft, working on various games at various positions.

        <b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayman_Raving_Rabbids_2'>
        Rayman Raving Rabbids 2</a></b> (Nintendo Wii) - 8 months<br>
        I joined the team at the beginning of the project and left to get back
        to school after the code freeze. I started by prototyping some
        mini-games, and then was responsible for a regular mini-game and all six
        FPS mini-games. As the only Gameplay Programmer on these, I wrote the
        code handling the game mechanisms such as AI code to handle all sorts of
        enemies.

        <b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Recon_Future_Soldier'>
        Ghost Recon: Future Soldier</a></b> (XBox 360/PS3) - 5 months<br>
        I improved re-usability, maintenance and quality of a core part of a
        10-year old game engine written in <code>C/C++</code> with a short-term
        goal of reducing memory usage. I started an effort to have the code
        covered by a test suite.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Undisclosed project</b> - 3 months<br>
        I was responsible for prototyping gameplay ideas for an experimental
        music-related game. This task required a lot of interactionis with the
        Game Designer and the ability to quickly implement ideas and improve
        them through try/fix iterations.
