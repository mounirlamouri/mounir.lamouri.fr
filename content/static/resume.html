  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>I am a Platform Engineer looking for challenging projects that have an
  impact on people.</p>

  <p>I worked in the video-game industry for a cumulative time of 2 years,
  shipping two AAA games and one independent game. Since then, I have been
  working on improving the Web Platform with Mozilla.</p>

  <p>I developed a keen interest in Web Standards and designing APIs for the
  Web and would like to keep working on making the Web a better place.</p>

  <p>I like to write clean, simple and tested code. My main programming language
  is C++ and I have - from little to heavy - professional experiences with C,
  Java, Python, Objective-C, Bash, and Javascript/HTML/CSS.</p>
