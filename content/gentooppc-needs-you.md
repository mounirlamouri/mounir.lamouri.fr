Gentoo/PPC team is here to make sure packages are marked stable and are
keyworded as soon as possible and without breaking the tree.
Unfortunately, we can't manage the flow of bugs coming and the list is
growing too quickly.  
Stabilizing and keywording is a big work. Fauli have explained it a few
weeks ago in a [blog entry](http://www.faulhammer.org/archiv-mainmenu-31/35-gentoo/298-architecture-work-the-way-i-do-it).

So if you have a PowerPC and you want to help, you can and we will
appreciate it !  
First of all, look at the [Gentoo/PPC testing doc](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/ppc/AT/index.xml). Some things may be
outdated, consider essentially the procedures.

I've made some bug lists to make the life of everybody easier:  
- [stabilization requests](http://tinyurl.com/gentoo-ppc-stablereq)  
- [keyword requests](http://tinyurl.com/gentoo-ppc-keywordreq)  
- [security bugs](http://tinyurl.com/gentoo-ppc-security)

Please, refer to the Gentoo/PPC testing doc if you want to help on one
of these bugs.

Do not hesitate to come see us on #gentoo-powerpc on freenode.
